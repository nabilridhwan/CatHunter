# Cat Hunter

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Purposes of each 'tech' stack

- Docker*: To run the MySQL database
- Prisma*: ORM used to interact with the database, so that we can use TypeScript and don't have to write raw SQL
- Vite (React frontend): Frontend application
- Nx: Monorepo management. This allows me to share code between the backend and frontend via packages I create (one example of the package I created is `@cathunt/types`)

## Run

```shell
docker compose up # Starts docker compose (for database). PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DOCKER INSTALLED!
nx run cat-hunter:serve # Starts the frontend
nx run cat-hunter-backend:serve:development # Starts the backend
```
